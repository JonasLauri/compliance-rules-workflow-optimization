## Compliance Rules Workflow Optimization

This repository presents a real business case from the compliance area (FCP), where a recurring operational process was redesigned and optimized in collaboration with other teams.  
The improvement project took approximately 2–3 months and focused on streamlining daily and weekly workflows, reducing manual workload, and improving operational efficiency (FTE savings).

##

### Business Case Overview
Detailed process description and change documentation are available in the accompanying PDF:  
**Further Improvements for Temporary Business Rules Management.pdf**

This document outlines:
- The initial process challenges and inefficiencies  
- Implemented improvements and automation steps  
- Measurable impact on operational load  

##

### Improved Process Example
A GUI tool was introduced to automatically add and adjust weekly business rule settings within the compliance system — significantly reducing repetitive manual work.

> **Note:** The tool itself was created by another contributor.  
> My contribution focused on the idea, process mapping, developing supporting automations and business requirements documentation.

### Technologies
- **VBA** — internal data handling and macro support  
- **AutoHotkey** — automation enhancements using key bindings and workflow shortcuts  
- **Python** *(developed collaboratively with another associate)* — extended automation and data processing using:
  - `selenium` — browser automation  
  - `pandas` — data handling and transformation  
  - `requests` — API and system data retrieval  
  - `tkinter` — GUI creation and front-end automation  

##

### Outcome
- Reduced weekly manual effort  
- Improved rule consistency and accuracy  
- Enhanced cross-team collaboration and documentation flow
